		  <h2>Program​ Repair​ Golf</h2>
		</div>
			<p> The application presents users with ​ repair challenges ​ , consisting of a program's <br />
				source code, and a repair objective. The goal for the user will be to change the source code to <br />
				achieve the objective, with the minimum possible number of changes to the original code. The <br />
				shorter the repair, the better. The user will collect points from every challenge he/she is able to <br />
				repair,​ ​ with​ ​ more​ ​ points​ ​ being​ ​ assigned​ ​ as​ ​ repairs​ ​ are​ ​ shorter.<br />
			</p>
			<p>

				The application allows users <br />
				to register, and maintains a record for each registered user based on the points he/she earns by <br />
				resolving repair challenges. A repair challenge consists of a program's source code, and a <br />
				repair objective, that the user must achieve by modifying the source code. The user is awarded <br />
				points based on the complexity of the challenge, and the length of the repair, with a "the shorter <br />
				the better" policy. Repair goals can vary, from simple "make this program compile" to more <br />
				complex ones, such as "make this program pass all tests" and "make this program correctly sort <br />
				an​ ​ array". <br />
			</p>
			<p>				
				The challenges can only be created by registered users. <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				A​ challenge​ ​ involves: <br />
				● a name (Denomination name for the challenge) <br />
				● a language (Programming language in which is written the challenge) <br />
				● a difficulty (Determines difficulty of challenge from very easy to very hard) <br />
				● a type (compilation challenge, test passing challenge, verification challenge) <br />
				● a description (Describes what it’s the challenge about) <br />
				● a​ ​ program's​ ​ source​ ​ code <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Let the game begin!
